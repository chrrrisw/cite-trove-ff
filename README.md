## Firefox plugin to quote Trove newspaper text ##

The [Trove Newspaper site](http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper?q=) allows users to correct
newspaper OCR text for historical Australian Newspapers.

When quoting newspaper text for research purposes it is useful to quote the newspaper
title, date and page also. This addon gives a context menu item 'Cite Trove' that adds
your selected text and the newspaper information to the clipboard for pasting into
other documents.
